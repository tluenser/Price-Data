********* Walmart API - abbreviated *********

# Set a list of queries for the search-bar to run through
# Set an empty dataframe to store observations
# Begin for-loop
    # Set an empty temporary dataframe to store observations
    # Set parameters for accessing the Google SerpAPI platform, running through each query in the queries list
    # Run the API, for each query store the JSON results in a dictionary and keep the observation-section of the results
    # Set the temporary dataframe to be the results from the API queries, and add today's date as a column vector
    # Add the conditional statement to fill the original dataframe if empty, or append if there are already observations contained in the dataframe.
# Set today's date and save the dataframe as a CSV and XLSX file using today's date.

********* Google API *********

# Set a list of locations for the Google to specify when seeking results. This list causes the SerpAPI platform to iterate through different location urls
# Set an empty dataframe to store observations
# Begin for-loop
    # Set an empty temporary dataframe to store observations
    # Set parameters for accessing the Google SerpAPI platform, running through each query and location in their respective lists
    # Run the API, for each query store the JSON results in a dictionary and keep the observation-section of the results
    # Set the temporary dataframe to be the results from the API queries, and add today's date as a column vector
    # Add the conditional statement to fill the original dataframe if empty, or append if there are already observations contained in the dataframe.
# Set today's date and save the dataframe as a CSV and XLSX file using today's date.

********* Walmart API - extended *********

# Set a list of queries for the search-bar to run through
# Set a list of pages for the search-bar to run through
# Set an empty dataframe to store observations
# Begin for-loop
    # Set an empty temporary dataframe to store observations
    # Set parameters for accessing the Google SerpAPI platform, running through each query in the queries list
    # Run the API, for each query store the JSON results in a dictionary and keep the observation-section of the results
    # Set the temporary dataframe to be the results from the API queries, and add today's date as a column vector
    # Add the conditional statement to fill the original dataframe if empty, or append if there are already observations contained in the dataframe.
# Extract prices from 'primary_offer' dictionary-column
# Average min/max/offer price to normalize prices
# Set a category column vector and set categories based on query
# Set today's date and save the dataframe as a CSV and XLSX file using today's date.
